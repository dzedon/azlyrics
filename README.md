# AZ-Lyrics Scrapper

First step is to fill the database with artists
Then you need to fill that artist's 
items(albums and songs) again 5 elements for each.  

ATM, the filling method is dumb,
meaning if the artist is already in the database
calling fill endpoint will repopulate with
the same artists.

ATM, fills database with 5 artists names 
per letter.

ATM, no more than 2 songs lyrics per album 
are filled bc of timeout error.
